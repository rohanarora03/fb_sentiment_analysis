Congratulations Jackie! Before I retired I rode SEPTA every day whether it be the EL, Trolley system or Commuter trains. Her job is extremely important. She has to know all about her train mechanics, she just doesn't sit there and drive. I've been on many a train that broke down. It can be stressful.
She's the definition of a true railroader. She really couldn't have it any better.
Lovely lady and so nice her employers rate her so highly ....
Congratulations you make us women proud to call you sister
Very inspirational. Here's to many more years of doing what she loves.
Oh my, this is why Philadelphia is great, thanks Jackie for delivery all the precious cargo safely!
Really enjoyed listening to this lady, her calming voice made it more enjoyable...
AOL?! That's still a thing?
Is this video captioned?  If not please #captionit.  (open captions work for me but for some reason seems the closed caption part is broken on my end...).  Seems like a great story if I could hear more of it.  (I used to ride SEPTA buses and trains).
30 years is a long time to work the same job Good for her!
Way to go Tweed Video for producing such an amazing story along with AOL!
What a great story! Congratulations , hope you have many more years doing a job that you love!
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) needs more people like this person, because otherwise, it's pretty mediocre in terms of major city public transportation.
Speta's bus drivers are a totally different story. So happy to no longer be a Septa bus rider!!
Jen and Roxanne - another strong woman - just like you two.
What a wonderful story.  It's great when people find their calling in life!
I ❤️ this so much! I am a SEPTA rider and am grateful for all her hard work. Thank you and congrats on a wonderful career!
You are an inspiration for young people,
I've taken one to many SEPTA rides to watch this without some kind of PTSD flashback LOL!
What an aspiring story this world needs more of😉
Congratulations Jackie!  Job well done!
