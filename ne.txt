Is this video captioned?  If not please #captionit.  (open captions work for me but for some reason seems the closed caption part is broken on my end...).  Seems like a great story if I could hear more of it.  (I used to ride SEPTA buses and trains).
Speta's bus drivers are a totally different story. So happy to no longer be a Septa bus rider!!
Lisa Tom Tom Good story and good train driving scenes ðŸ™‚
Great story, thank you for sharing.
Congratulations Jackie! Before I retired I rode SEPTA every day whether it be the EL, Trolley system or Commuter trains. Her job is extremely important. She has to know all about her train mechanics, she just doesn't sit there and drive. I've been on many a train that broke down. It can be stressful.
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) needs more people like this person, because otherwise, it's pretty mediocre in terms of major city public transportation.
You are an inspiration for young people,
I've taken one to many SEPTA rides to watch this without some kind of PTSD flashback LOL!
